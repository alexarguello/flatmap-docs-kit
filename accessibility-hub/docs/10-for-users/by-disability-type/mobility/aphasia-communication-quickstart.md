Caring for someone with aphasia after a stroke can feel overwhelming, but you are not alone. This guide is designed to help you support communication, independence, and emotional well-being for your loved one. We’ve included practical strategies, technology tools, and community resources—all explained in clear, supportive language.

## What is Aphasia?
- **Aphasia** is a language disorder caused by brain injury (often stroke) that affects speaking, understanding, reading, or writing. People with aphasia may know what they want to say but struggle to express it or understand others.
- **Other terms you may hear:**
  - **Apraxia of Speech:** Difficulty planning the movements needed for speech.
  - **Dysarthria:** Slurred or weak speech due to muscle weakness.
- Aphasia does not affect intelligence. Your loved one is still themselves and can learn new ways to communicate.


## Immediate Communication Strategies
- **Yes/No Gestures:**
  - Agree on simple signals (thumbs up/down, head nod/shake, eye movements) for yes/no answers. Practice these together so everyone understands.
  - Use these signals for daily questions: “Are you hungry?” “Do you want to go outside?”
- **Picture Board:**
  - Create a laminated board with clear images for basic needs (food, bathroom, pain, help, emotions, family, phone). Pointing to pictures can help express needs when words are hard.
  - You can make your own or use free online templates.
- **Audio Prompts:**
  - Record short, familiar questions or statements ("Do you need water?", "Are you comfortable?") on your phone or tablet. Play these as needed to help with routines.
- **Consistent Routines:**
  - Use the same signals, prompts, and questions every day. Consistency helps reduce confusion and builds confidence.

**How to choose:**

## Therapy & Professional Support

  - SLPs are experts in communication and can help set up AAC tools, train caregivers, and provide therapy.

  - OTs help adapt devices and routines for daily living.

- **Local Support:**
  - Ask your hospital’s social worker for local support groups or WhatsApp communities.
  - Rehabilitation centers often offer caregiver support meetings—these are great for sharing experiences and learning from others.
- **Emotional Care:**
  - Schedule regular check-ins with family and friends. Even short voice messages or music playlists can lift spirits.
  - If stress or sadness feels overwhelming, ask for a referral to a psychologist or counselor.

## Questions to Help Tailor Support
Asking these questions can help you and your clinical team find the best solutions:
- What language(s) does your loved one prefer for voice output?
- Which gestures or movements are most reliable for yes/no?
- Are there any vision or hearing issues?
- What are the most important daily needs (food, pain, family contact)?
- Has your loved one used AAC or speech therapy before?
- Is there a budget for paid apps or devices?
- What content does your loved one enjoy (music, family voices, news)?

## Quick Start Checklist
- Set up a tablet with large icons for “Call Family,” “Messages (Voice),” and “Listen” (podcasts or TTS).
- Install Cboard and Google Look to Speak.
- Create a laminated picture board and yes/no cards. Place them within easy reach.
- Record short audio prompts for daily needs and routines.
- Schedule an SLP evaluation as soon as possible.
- Keep a daily log of what communication strategies work best.
