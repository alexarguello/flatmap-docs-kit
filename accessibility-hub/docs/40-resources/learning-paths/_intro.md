### Role-Based Learning Paths

Use these outlines to focus your learning on the skills most relevant to your role.

#### Designer (2–4 weeks)
- **Principles**: Master inclusive design, WCAG fundamentals, color contrast, and motion sensitivity.
- **Patterns**: Learn to design accessible components (modals, tabs, menus) and define responsive touch targets.
- **Deliverables**: Practice creating annotations for focus order, error states, and accessible names.
- **Key Resource**: [Stark's Library of Accessibility Resources for Designers](https://www.getstark.co/for-designers/)

#### Front-end Developer (4–6 weeks)
- **Fundamentals**: Deeply understand semantic HTML, ARIA, and keyboard interaction patterns.
- **Components**: Learn to build robust forms, dialogs, and manage focus effectively using the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).
- **Testing**: Integrate automated checks (e.g., `axe-core`) and practice manual testing with screen readers.
- **Key Resource**: [MDN Web Docs: Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

#### QA / Tester (2–4 weeks)
- **Methodology**: Develop test plans covering automated, manual, and assistive technology testing scenarios.
- **Tools**: Become proficient with tools like [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview) and the [WAVE Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/).
- **Reporting**: Learn to file actionable bug reports that include reproduction steps, expected behavior, and relevant WCAG criteria.
- **Key Resource**: [DHS Trusted Tester Program](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester)

#### Product / Leadership (1–2 weeks)
- **Strategy**: Understand the legal landscape (WCAG, Section 508, EN 301 549) and the business case for accessibility.
- **Governance**: Learn how to integrate accessibility into your product lifecycle, from design to release.
- **Metrics**: Define and track metrics to measure progress and demonstrate impact.
- **Key Resource**: [W3C's Business Case for Digital Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/)
