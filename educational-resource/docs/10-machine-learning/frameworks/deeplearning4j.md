Deeplearning4j (DL4J) is a comprehensive deep learning library for Java and the JVM. It provides tools for building and training neural networks, with support for various architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.

The library integrates seamlessly with the Java ecosystem and offers distributed training capabilities. DL4J is particularly well-suited for enterprise applications that require scalable deep learning solutions within existing Java infrastructure.
