Supporting a loved one after stroke involves patience, creativity, and knowledge of communication strategies.

### 🧠 Understand the Impact
- Stroke may affect speech, comprehension, memory, and motor skills.
- Aphasia can make it hard to speak or understand language.
- Emotional changes like frustration or withdrawal are common.

### 🗣️ Communication Tips
- Use short, clear sentences.
- Ask yes/no questions when possible.
- Encourage gestures, drawing, or pointing.
- Repeat or rephrase if needed—don’t rush.

### 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- Use visual aids: photo albums, labeled objects, or printed routines.
- Create a quiet, distraction-free environment for conversation.

### 🤝 Emotional Support
