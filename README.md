# Accessibility Hub

Welcome to the **Accessibility Hub**—your central resource for accessible technology, inclusive design, and community-driven support. Our mission is to empower everyone, regardless of ability, to access, contribute to, and benefit from digital resources.

This hub is:

- Open to all: people with disabilities, developers, educators, advocates, and allies
- Curated for easy navigation, comparison, and deep dives into accessibility topics
- Community-driven, always growing with your contributions
- Organized with a clear tag system for quick discovery
- A mix of original guides, curated links, and practical tools
- Welcoming feedback to improve both content and accessibility

Note on accessibility: Headings and primary link labels are plain text per our Accessible Emoji Policy. Decorative emojis may appear in body text with clear textual equivalents.
