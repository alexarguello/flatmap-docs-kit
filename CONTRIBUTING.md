# 🤝 Contributing to the Accessibility Hub
Thank you for your interest in contributing to our **Accessibility Hub**!
Our mission is to create the **most reliable, well-organized, and user-friendly resource** for anyone involved in making the world more accessible. This includes tools, guidelines, and resources for improving digital accessibility in areas such as screen readers, assistive technologies, visual impairments, and more.
By contributing, you help developers, individuals with disabilities, accessibility testers, educators, and advocates find the resources they need to support accessible technology.
## 🥅 Goals of the Accessibility Hub
1. **Promote Awareness**: Provide actionable and relatable accessibility information.
2. **Serve All Skill Levels**: Create resources for **beginners, experienced professionals, educators**, and **end users**.
3. **Cover Diverse Topics**: Include tools, best practices, regulations, user experience insights, and accessibility technologies.
4. **Improve Accessibility Culture**: Reduce barriers and make digital spaces inclusive.

## 📝 How to Contribute
Not sure where to start? Here’s how you can pitch in:
### 1. **Browse Current Needs**
Check the last section in the sidebar called `Contribute`. Here you'll find examples of **resources we need**, as well as requests for improvements to existing materials.
### 2. **Add or Improve Resources**
Have your own idea? Follow these steps:
- Browse `/docs/` to find the right folder for your topic.
- Copy the [`/docs/.template.md`](educational-resource/docs/.template.md) file as a starting point for your new resource.
- Rename your file (e.g., `screen-readers.md`, `dos-and-donts.md`).

⚠️ Do not name files `intro.md` or `index.md` — these are reserved for folder landing pages.

### 3. **Write and Format the Frontmatter**
At the top of every Markdown file, include your **frontmatter** to classify, tag, and describe the resource. 
Frontmatter is essential YAML metadata included in every resource file to ensure classification, seamless system integration, and proper organization. Here are the key highlights:

1. **Purpose**: Frontmatter provides structure by categorizing and describing resources, making them easier to manage and access.
2. **Required Fields**:
  - `title`: A concise, descriptive name for the resource (e.g., "Introduction to ARIA").
  - `type`: The content type (e.g., `overview`, `guide`, `tutorial`, `reference`).
  - `level`: The intended audience expertise level (`beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced`).
  - `status`: The development stage of the resource (`draft`, `wip`, `published`).
  - `topics`: Tags summarizing the content, with a focus on:
    - Broad categories like `accessibility`.
    - Specific prefixes such as `assistive-technology`.
    - More about topics [here](/TOPICS_GUIDE.md)

For the full guide, refer to [FRONTMATTER_GUIDE.md](FRONTMATTER_GUIDE.md).


### 4. **Submit a Pull Request**
Create a Pull Request (PR) in our GitHub repository. Include a summary of your changes, why they're important, and mention any related GitHub issues.


## 📌 About `intro.md` Pages
Each directory in `/docs/` can have an `intro.md` as a **topic landing page**.
### Guidelines for `intro.md` Files
- Keep it **short and clear** (max 2–3 paragraphs).
- Define the purpose of the section and direct users to subtopics.
- Mention the expected audience, whether beginners, experienced developers, end-users, or educators.
- Ensure the section remains partially visible above **visual diagrams** or **flatmaps** on the site.

## ✅ Pull Request Guidelines
When submitting a PR, ensure:
- All **required frontmatter fields** are present.
- **Optional fields** are only added if relevant (e.g., `eta` for planned work).
- Files are placed in the correct folder within `/docs/`.
- Your content aligns with our **accessibility-first values**.

Our automated PR checks will validate:
- Proper metadata format and values.
- Required fields like `title`, `type`, `level`, and `topics`.
- **For planned or in-progress resources**: an `eta` field (completion date) must be included.

⚠️ **Tip**: If there’s an issue or discussion related to your PR, reference it in the description!

## Available Topics and Prefixes
To maintain consistency, use the following **topics** when tagging your content:
### General Categories
- `accessibility`
- `assistive-technology`
- `visual-impairment`
- `design-principles`
- `standards` (WCAG, ARIA, etc.)

### Tools (Prefix: `tool:`)
- `tool:JAWS`
- `tool:NVDA`
- `tool:VoiceOver`
- `tool:Narrator`
- `tool:Orca`

### Providers (Prefix: `provider:`)
- `provider:freedom-scientific`
- `provider:microsoft`
- `provider:apple`
- `provider:nv-access`

Include your tags as **specific and accurate as possible** — these improve searchability and structure for other contributors.

## ✍️ Formatting and Writing Guidelines
1. **Focus on Accessibility**: Write with an accessibility-first mindset, including inclusive examples (e.g., using headings, lists, and descriptive text).
2. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid technical jargon whenever possible. Cater to all skill levels.
3. **Cite Reliable Sources**: Reference official accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG, ARIA specifications).
4. **Test Recommendations**: Ensure tools or techniques described in your resource are tested and validated.

## ⭐ Contributor Responsibilities
Contributors help ensure this hub is **valuable and up-to-date** by:
- Responding to resource requests.
- Keeping planned content on schedule (`eta` informed).
- Updating `draft` or `wip` resources once complete.

## “Planned” or “Work in Progress” Resources
If your resource is still being developed, set its `status` to `planned` or `wip` and include an **estimated completion date** (`eta`).
**Why?**:
- It prevents duplication.
- Maintainers and other contributors can monitor progress or assist.
